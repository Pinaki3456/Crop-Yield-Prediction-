# Crop-Yield-Prediction-
The proposed agricultural solution addresses the challenges faced by Indian agriculture, which has seen declining contributions to GDP and employment due to outdated practices, inadequate infrastructure, limited technology access, and climate change impacts. Soil quality is crucial for agricultural productivity, influenced by factors such as nutrient levels, pH, and moisture content. The project involves developing an IoT-based platform integrated with sensors to monitor soil conditions in real-time. Using Arduino UNO for sensor connectivity (including NPK, moisture, and DHT11 sensors) and a Wi-Fi module, data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud for storage and analysis. Machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, predicts crop types, yields, prices, and fertilizer needs based on soil data. A Flask-based web interface incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction and visualization. This comprehensive approach aims to provide accurate soil analysis, optimize crop management, and enhance sustainability in Indian agriculture.
